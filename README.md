# Delhi-Metrol-Optimization-Using-Python
## Overview
This project aims to optimize the metro routes and scheduling in Delhi to enhance efficiency and reduce travel time. The solution is implemented in Python and leverages various algorithms and data analysis techniques to achieve the optimization goals.

#Features
Route Optimization: Identifies the most efficient routes between metro stations.
Scheduling Optimization: Optimizes metro train schedules to minimize wait times and avoid congestion.
Real-time Updates: Integrates real-time data to adjust schedules dynamically.
Visualization: Provides visual representations of routes and schedules for better understanding and analysis.

#Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
NetworkX
Geopy
Other dependencies (if any)
You can install the required packages using the following command:

#Data Preparation:
Ensure that you have the required data files in the data directory. This includes metro station information, schedules, and real-time data files.
Run the Optimization Script:
Execute the main script to start the optimization process:

# Visualization:
The script will generate visualizations that can be found in the output directory. Open these files to analyze the optimized routes and schedules.
